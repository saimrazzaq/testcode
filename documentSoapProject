STUB IMPLEMENTATION
1.	I have used SOAP UI to create a rest project for the implementation of github api.
2.	You will need SOAP UI installed on your machine to test these scenarios.
3.	You can import the xml file after clicking on import project from File Menu of SOAP UI.
4.	Two very basic test cases are implemented
a)	Root End Point
b)	Search for all the repos with the name tetris
5.	I did not added any assertions but for any test step, there should be assertions like 200 https status code or if we need to see a particular value in response.
